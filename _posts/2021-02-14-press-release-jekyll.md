Silver Foxes, a software development team affiliated with the Spring 2021 Software Engineering course at the University of Mount Union, announces the 

Silver Surfer Project!

The project is a web application for professors in the UMU CS department to use to create websites for their classes. The application provides a text area into which professors enter their content and provides a complete website for them to use. Our template will automatically surround their content with HTML and CSS styling.

The Silver Surfer Projectâ€™s aim is to provide professors with websites that are functional, easy to navigate, and have a consistent layout. This will allow students to easily navigate their classes and plan for coursework. The project will make it easier for professors and students to communicate as well.
