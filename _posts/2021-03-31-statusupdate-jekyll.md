Today we had our status meeting and showed the progress we have made on the project thus far. At this point we have a cohesive format/appearance for all pages. We also have many of the needed React components created and have started implementing them in our pages. 

Now that our authentication and APIs are created we will be able to really start diving into the abilities of adding the admin's ability of adding content to the pages. We also plan on adding more styling to the current pages now that we have more information from the current Silver Server. 

We are confident that we will be able to complete our highest priority requirements for the final due date approaching at the end of April. We have also adjusted our timeline and the various tasks we needed to add.
