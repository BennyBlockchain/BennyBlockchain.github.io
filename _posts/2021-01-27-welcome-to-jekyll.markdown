For our SCE this semester we plan on recreating the computer science department's silver server web pages so that they have more functionality and are more unified in appearance.



Over the course of this semester we will be posting our progress here in this blog. We hope to keep everyone updated with our progress and lessons we learn during this process. Our team consists of Amanda Hegidus, Faith Haiss, Ben Schroth, and Marisa Stover. This is an exciting time as we continue to work on this project and watch it slowly come to life. 

Stay tuned for more updates!
